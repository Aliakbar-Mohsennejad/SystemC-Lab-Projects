#  SystemC Lab Projects – Digital Design & Embedded Modeling

Welcome to my collection of **SystemC-based lab projects**, implemented as part of the _Hardware/Software Co-Design_ and _System-Level Digital Design_ course at **K. N. Toosi University of Technology**.

Each project demonstrates a fundamental or advanced digital concept modeled using SystemC, from simple logic gates to full FSM-based systems with interrupt controllers and waveform tracing.
